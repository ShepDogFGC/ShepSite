### Hello World!

If you're reading this then I assume I've pushed this to production properly, and I'm sure you're surprised to see that I'm actually working on the site now.

This is because I've **finally** completed my degree and I'm graduating college! After five long years I finally have my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science & Engineering, with a Minor in Philosophy. I'm very excited to be done and to begin the next chapter of my life.

### Projects

Now with this all said, I'm sure you're wondering what the next stages are for me. Well I have quite a bit going on at the moment but I do have a plan in store for the rest of the year (somewhat).

The big side project I'll be working on is this website. This thing has been in the making since this time LAST year and obviously there hasn't been much done on it, and I want to change that. I'm hoping to get a final draft of the finished product up and running by the end of the year in preparation for getting myself more known in 2023, but we'll see how it goes! I have my doubts about getting this site to where I want it to be, but that's not gonna stop me!

I'm planning on keeping my ideas and progress about the site very public (as I don't really see a reason not to do so) so that will be the next update to the site; being able to see my decision making and progress in real time, using notion.so as the main source of data.

### Current & Future Plans

Currently I'm planning on continuing to work for rebel Financial as their (only) Jr. Software Engineer, while looking for other opportunities that catch my eye, but no major job hunting is currently in the forecast. I got a lot of things happening right now and after finishing my degree, I need to let myself slow down a little bit and collect myself before putting my nose to the grindstone.

That said however, I do plan on getting out to the west coast early 2023 if everything goes according to plan!

For now that's all I got. Stay safe out there, and if you have any inquiries, please feel free to send me an email at nShepard204@gmail.com

Cheers!
